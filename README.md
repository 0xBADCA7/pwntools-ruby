# pwntools-ruby

Always sad when playing CTF that there's nothing equivalent to pwntools in Python.
While pwntools is awesome, I always love Ruby far more than Python...
So this is an attempt to create such library.

There's absolutely NOTHING here now.
Going to implement important things (socket, tubes, asm/disasm, pack/unpack utilities) first.
Would try to have consistent naming with original pwntools, and do things in Ruby style.
